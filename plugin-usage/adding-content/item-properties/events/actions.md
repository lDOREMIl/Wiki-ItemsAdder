# Actions

Actions are what will happen when an [event](./) is triggered.

## List of actions

To read the list of available actions use the official editor.

{% content-ref url="../../../files-editor.md" %}
[files-editor.md](../../../files-editor.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Available command placeholders

* `{player}` you
* `{target-player}` targeted player/victim
* `{target-x}|{target-y}|{target-z}` x/y/z location of targeted player/victim
* `{target-world}` targeted world

### Delay

Every action has a special attribute **delay**.\
It's the **delay** in ticks before starting the action.\
For example:

```yaml
items:
  chain_events:
    display_name: "%#FE5A00%chain_events"
    permission: test.chain_events
    resource:
      material: COAL
      generate: true
      textures:
      - "minecraft:item/diamond.png"
    events:
      interact:
        right:
          execute_commands:
            cmd1:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 1","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 0
            cmd2:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 2","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 20
            cmd3:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 3","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 40
          play_sound_1:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            delay: 0
          play_sound_2:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            pitch: 1.2
            delay: 20
          play_sound_3:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            pitch: 1.5
            delay: 40
```

### Multiple actions of the same type

You can set the same action multiple times. You just have to add `_anything` at the end.\
For example if you want to play two sounds you have to write this:

```yaml
play_sound_first:
  name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
play_sound_second:
  name: minecraft:ambient.cave
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
play_sound_3:
  name: minecraft:ambient.cave
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
```

### Actions permission

Every action has a special attribute **permission**.\
It's the **permission** the player must have before starting the **action**.\
For example the player must have `myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser` permission to play the sound.\
NOTE: In this example you will notice an issue.\
The sound is played even if the user has no permission for the give event. That's because permission check is only on the `give_item`.

```yaml
  test_block:
    display_name: display-name-test_block
    permission: test_block
    resource:
      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/test_block.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          break_particles_material: SMITHING_TABLE
    events:
      placed_block:
        interact:
          give_item:
            permission: "myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser"
            item: DIAMOND
          play_sound:
            name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
            volume: 1
            pitch: 1
```

**Setting the same permission to every action**

If you want to set the same permission to every action without copy and paste you can!\
Use this special attribute `all_actions_permission`.\
For example:

```yaml
  test_block:
    display_name: display-name-test_block
    permission: test_block
    resource:
      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/test_block.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          break_particles_material: SMITHING_TABLE
    all_actions_permission: "myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser"
    events:
      placed_block:
        interact:
          give_item:
            item: DIAMOND
      play_sound:
        name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
        volume: 1
        pitch: 1
```

### Properties

Use the [official files editor](../../../files-editor.md) to get the complete list while working on your configurations.

## Flow customization

The plugin allows you to further customize your actions by avoiding their execution in some specific cases explained in the next lines.\
This allows further customization of your items logic.

For example you can create a wand which plays specific sound only if a mob was successfully attacked and which plays another sound in case of failed attack.

### Using vanilla `execute if`

In some cases you might want to do some specific checks on scoreboard, blocks and similar using the vanilla `/execute if` command.

For example this item makes the player teleport 2 blocks up only if the `example_score` value is 0.

```yaml
info:
  namespace: test
items:
  test_flow:
    enabled: true
    display_name: test_flow
    resource:
      generate: false
      model_path: minecraft:item/diamond
      material: DIAMOND
    events:
      interact:
        right:
          execute_commands_1:
            cause_command:
              command: 'execute if score {player} example_score matches 0'
              as_console: true
              delay: 0
          execute_commands_2:
            effect_command:
              command: 'tp {player} ~ ~2 ~'
              as_console: true
            flow:
              skip_if_fail: execute_commands_1
```
